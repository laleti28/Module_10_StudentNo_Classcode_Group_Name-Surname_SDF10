## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

API-Application programming interface is the tools used to build an application , these tools helps with the interaction of software ,it is important as it helps programmers with the integration of the functionality of other software systems into their own applications without having to build everything.The practical expirence i have with API was when me and my class coded a weather app , as the rules we made in the web site we were coding interacted with another software providing us with the weather information.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

Interface- The interaction between two systems or devices and API- is an interaction between softwares its interactions are defined through rules.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

End point - an end point is a specific path that applications use to communicate with each other.
Method - methods that specificy the actions e.g Get - which is to get data from other sources ,Post- subitting data , Put -adding data , Delete- removing data and many others 

Web APIs- A Web API is an interface for a web server or a web browser. They allow software applications to communicate with each other using standard protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS.

RESTful APIs- REST-Representational State Transfer -designing networked applications. They use the principles of REST for communication and to attain resource-based URIs, standard HTTP methods

i find REST more intriging as we see it all the time , especially when we are coding and we run past a big error and the live server shows 404 which refers to a error 

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

i havent done any practical exploration with curl or other tools , i have been too focused on watching the videos and learning theoractical stuff but from my understanding Client URL ,Curl lets developers transfer data across various network protocols.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

i feel confident in the components of API as we use it daily , i still have a lot to learn in terms of the tools , to enhance my skill i will do my own research and do the practicals in all API areas .
