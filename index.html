API-Application programming interface is the tools used to build an application , these tools helps with the interaction of software ,
it is important as it helps programmers with the integration of the functionality of other software systems into their own applications without having to build everything.
The practical expirence i have with API was when me and my class coded a weather app , as the rules we made in the web site we were coding interacted with another software providing us with the weather information.

        <h2 class="H">Types of APIs</h2>

        An end point is a specific path that applications use to communicate with each other.
        Method - methods that specificy the actions e.g 
        <li>Get - which is to get data from other sources</li>
        <li>  Post- subitting data </li> 
        <li>Put -adding data</li>
        <li>Delete- removing data and many others</li>

        <h3 class="3"> Web API and REST</h3>

        <img class="img"   src="img/OIP (1).jpeg">

        Web APIs- A Web API is an interface for a web server or a web browser. They allow software applications to communicate with each other using standard protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS.<br>

RESTful APIs- REST-Representational State Transfer -designing networked applications. They use the principles of REST for communication and to attain resource-based URIs, standard HTTP methods<br>

i find REST more intriging as we see it all the time , especially when we are coding and we run past a big error and the live server shows 404 which refers to a error
